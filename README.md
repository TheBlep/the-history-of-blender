## Visual Design
### Frameworks
Templates for HTML framework were made using Chat GPT and edited apon with Bootstrap and code snippets from the course.

### Fonts
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/fontsdesiplay.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

- The primary font, [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was chosen because it seemed to fit well with the minimal look of the website.
- The secondary font, serif was chosen due to its default nature in HTML as well as to simplify the development.

### Icons
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/footerlinks.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised with the "fab fa-..." classes
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social account icons.

### Colors
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/websire-colors.png" alt="Color Pallette">
</div>

- The site is designed with a minimal aesthetic, ensuring the content remains the focus without distractions.
- White is the primary color, providing a clean backdrop that enhances readability and directs attention to the information.
- A light accent color, chosen for subtle warmth, is used sparingly to highlight key sections and guide the user’s eye.
- Text is presented in black or dark grey for clear contrast against the light background, making the content easy to read.
- A neutral grey color is used for the footer, helping to visually separate it from the main content and maintain a clean layout.


### Images
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/images1.png" alt="First Images">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/images2.png" alt="Second Images">
</div>

- The site has a large focus on images, showcasing the evolution of visuals developed in Blender.
- On the home page the images are displayed in three columns responsively, so they can easily be seen on any size device.
- The images and respective text will automatically space themselves vertically within the column, so the column is never too thin.

### Styling
- For this project I have utilised Bootstrap 5.3 CSS and JS libraries to ease development on the navigation bar, buttons, contact form and content responsivness.
- The primary and secondary colors have been applied to bootstrap classes for easy use across the site.

# Features
## Page Elements
### All Pages
#### Navbar
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/navbar.png" alt="Medium Header">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/navbar-small.png" alt="Small Header">
</div>

- The Navbar is simple, providing only two major options and one contact option.
- The Logo is always isolated and easy to read, adapting to smaller screens.
- On smaller devices, the menu becomes collapsible.
- The mobile nav button has been placed to the right for ease of use with one hand.

#### Footer
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/footer.png" alt="Medium Footer">
</div>

- Located at the bottom of every page, highlighting the (non existant) privacy policy and terms of service additionally to the contact page.
- Made of three columns, changing shape for larger or smaller devices.

### Index Page
#### Short films
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/short-films.png" alt="About">
</div>

- Minimal and direct approach with information on the first official short films of the Blender institute.
- Three columns are used with images first to intice the user to continue further and read the text. 
- Text contains a links to further reading or the short film itself.

#### What Blender has become
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/what-become.png" alt="About">
</div>

- After the initial image to give a foundation, the "What Blender has become" section presents the contrasting modern status and visuals of Blender
- Hopefully, the impact will create enough interest to read the further text and/or proceed to the resources page.
- The section is responsive and the three columns will stack on resize.

### Resource Page
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/resources.png" alt="Resource Page">
</div>

- Matching the minimal style of the index page, the resource page contains two rows each with two columns, one image, one text with link.
- The first row gives a link directly to the Blender home page and further information.
- The second link sends the user to a few tutorials perfect for beginners wanting to start learning Blender.

### Contact Page
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/contact.png" alt="Contact page">
</div>

- A simple page highlighting the contact form that utilises the bootstrap contact form, sending the information to a confirmation page highlighting the information sent.
- There is an unused "Success page" that could be implemented.
- Once the send button is pressed, the Code Institute verification page will open, notifying the user what data was sent.
- Any fields not correctly filled out will yeild an error message, notifying the user of the missing information and preventing submission.

## Feature Ideas
- Content!
- Contact page could have more info on it regarding why you would want to contact the author.
- The about page could be better structured and contane a more fluid explaination.
- The story telling could be improved with a clear line to follow
- Gifs could be inserted instead of images ot more clearly create an impact with things that require movmetn to digest, such as particle simulations and dynamic geometry nodes.
-Resources could be more compact and varied to allow more directions for further reading.
