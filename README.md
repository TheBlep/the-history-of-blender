## Visual Design
### Frameworks
Templates for HTML framework were made using Chat GPT and edited apon with Bootstrap and code snippets from the course.

### Fonts
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/fontsdesiplay.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

- The primary font, [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald) was chosen because it seemed to fit well with the minimal look of the website.
- The secondary font, serif was chosen due to its default nature in HTML as well as to simplify the development.

### Icons
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/footerlinks.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

- Icons are taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised with the "fab fa-..." classes
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social account icons.

### Colors
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/websire-colors.png" alt="Color Pallette">
</div>

- The site is designed with a minimal aesthetic, ensuring the content remains the focus without distractions.
- White is the primary color, providing a clean backdrop that enhances readability and directs attention to the information.
- A light accent color, chosen for subtle warmth, is used sparingly to highlight key sections and guide the user’s eye.
- Text is presented in black or dark grey for clear contrast against the light background, making the content easy to read.
- A neutral grey color is used for the footer, helping to visually separate it from the main content and maintain a clean layout.


### Images
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/images1.png" alt="First Images">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/images2.png" alt="Second Images">
</div>

- The site has a large focus on images, showcasing the evolution of visuals developed in Blender.
- On the home page the images are displayed in three columns responsively, so they can easily be seen on any size device.
- The images and respective text will automatically space themselves vertically within the column, so the column is never too thin.

### Styling
- For this project I have utilised Bootstrap 5.3 CSS and JS libraries to ease development on the navigation bar, buttons, contact form and content responsivness.
- The primary and secondary colors have been applied to bootstrap classes for easy use across the site.

# Features
## Page Elements
### All Pages
#### Navbar
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/navbar.png" alt="Medium Header">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/navbar-small.png" alt="Small Header">
</div>

- The Navbar is simple, providing only two major options and one contact option.
- The Logo is always isolated and easy to read, adapting to smaller screens.
- On smaller devices, the menu becomes collapsible.
- The mobile nav button has been placed to the right for ease of use with one hand.

#### Footer
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/footer.png" alt="Medium Footer">
</div>

- Located at the bottom of every page, highlighting the (non existant) privacy policy and terms of service additionally to the contact page.
- Made of three columns, changing shape for larger or smaller devices.

### Index Page
#### Short films
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/short-films.png" alt="About">
</div>
- Minimal and direct approach with information on the first official short films of the Blender institute.
- Three columns are used with images first to intice the user to continue further and read the text. 
- Text contains a links to further reading or the short film itself.

#### What Blender has become
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/what-become.png" alt="About">
</div>
<div align="center">
  <img src="" alt="About">
</div>

- After the initial image to give a foundation, the "What Blender has become" section presents the contrasting modern status and visuals of Blender
- Hopefully, the impact will create enough interest to read the further text and/or proceed to the resources page.
- The section is responsive and the three columns will stack on resize.

### Resource Page
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme-images/resources.png" alt="Resource Page">
</div>
- Matching the minimal style of the index page, the resource page contains two rows each with two columns, one image, one text with link.
-The first row gives a link directly to the Blender home page and further information.
- The second link sends the user to a few tutorials perfect for beginners wanting to start learning Blender.

### Contact Page
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44118951/92344558-159d2600-f0c7-11ea-9e1d-836b5bc2586a.png" alt="Iframe Gallery">
</div>

- A simple page highlighting the author with a contact form that utilises [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send the emails.
- The form has validation and is fully responsive.
- Once the send button is pressed, a modal will open notifying the user that the message is sending.
- The modal has fields that are modified by the `sendMail.js` script.
- A success or an error message will be displayed depending on the result.
- The form fields will be cleared only on a successful response.
- A response message is sent to every email received, set up in EmailJS as a template.

## Additional Features
### Image Loading Blur
- All images utilise a loading blur function to smooth out their loading as the high-quality images can slow things down.
- The function places a low-quality thumbnail as the default image, covering it with a CSS blur filter.
- Simultaneously, it loads the full quality image set as the background image. Once it detects it is loaded it adds a class.
- The class makes the thumbnail transparent, using animation to smooth the transition.
- Had to be carefully used to correctly open the image modal.

### Email
- EmailJS is functional on every page through the newsletter form.
- The newsletter form has all the same basic features, like the contact form; validation, the modal, success and error messages are all present.
- Differentiates between the contact page form for messages and the newsletter form.

## Feature Ideas
### Basic
- A selection of countries to click on that brings you directly to the gallery.
- The ability to share photos directly to social media.
- Purchasing on the site
- More details about countries.

### Content 
- A wider range of countries and images. At the moment I didn't want to clutter the map.
- The user selects a country and an API pull in relevant images of that location.
- An API wherein the placename and the blurb are automatically generated.
- Blog posts on the website for more flavour text.
